# Optiver-volatility-prediction
Modelling realised volatility of stocks in a 10 minutes window given previous 10 minutes book and trade data of the stocks.

## Conclusion: LGBM & regression with correlation-aware features works well and achieves CV RMSPE 0.19!

## General info

The project is meant to compare classical Time Series models, such as ARIMA method with the recently emerged transformer model.

Major steps involved in classical time series analysis were as follow :                                 
* STEP: 1 - Data Cleaning 
* STEP: 2 - Transformation, Feature engineering
* STEP: 3 - Compare models: Regression,  Gradient Boosting
* STEP: 4 - Submission and reassess models
